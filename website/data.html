				<h2>Where is the data from?</h2>
				<p style="bottom:-10%"> <b style="color:#64add8">How did you collect your data?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> For each entry in our table, we scraped a page on the Gun Violence Archive: <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/">https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/</a>. After some initial work, we were able to locate an old repository that had scraped the same kind of data from this site up until the beginning of 2018. We scraped the rest on our own.  <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> Received from the US
					census in csv format, read into a sql database.
					Light data processing completed.
					<a
						href="https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml">https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml</a><br>
					<b> Housing Price Database: </b>
					Zillow has compiled home value estimates for different regions, with data
					extending back to 1996. We downloaded monthly data as a csv and then loaded it into a SQL
					database. Light processing was done (lowercasing names, removing special characters and
					whitespace) so that fields would be easier to join with other tables.
					<a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ ">https://www.zillow.com/research/data/</a><br><br>
					<b style="color:#64add8">Is the source reputable?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> Yes, the Gun Violence Archive has been actively maintained since 2013 by a non-profit organization that scrapes the internet for instances of Gun Violence. The scraped data is monitored and validated by a dedicated team. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> Yes, it is from the US Census of 2010. May be a bit outdated but
					should be fine for our purposes as an estimate of general US population. <br>
					<b> Housing Price Database: </b> Yes, Zillow is a well established real estate marketplace founded
					by former Microsoft executives. Though they are certainly reputable, the data provided is still just
					an estimate of the true housing price in an area. However, the ZHVI metric that Zillow provides is a
					good representation of the average housing price value for an area. <br><br>

					<b style="color:#64add8">How did you generate the sample? Is it comparably small or large? Is it
						representative or is it likely to exhibit some kind of sampling bias?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> The sample was generated by scraping https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> Received it as a csv from the US census. Database is fairly
					comprehensive and contains a total of 40,840 examples by cities,counties, and states. <br>
					<b> Housing Price Database: </b> Downloaded a csv from Zillow research. It has up to 25 years of
					price data at a monthly resolution for over 27,000 US cities which makes it relatively large
					compared to other datasets. Other sources for housing price estimates often had lower spatial and
					temporal resolution in their sampling, frequently giving quarterly estimates or only estimating by
					state or metro area. The price index provided by Zillow should be a representative sample since it
					includes every town and city in the US. Some cities are missing data from certain years, but their
					is no indication of bias in these omissions. <br><br>

					<b style="color:#64add8">Are there any other considerations you took into account when collecting
						your data?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> There might be issues of privacy accessing information about incidents that could be incredibly traumatic for some people. Also, despite our high confidence in the data source, we cannot be totally sure that important gun violence data wasn’t omitted (due to failures in visibility, reporting, or scraping) in statistically significant patterns that would render our findings irrelevant. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> In general, population data seems more informative than anything and
					is not problematic.<br>
					<b> Housing Price Database: </b> It was important that the measure of average housing price be
					comparable between cities. We first considered the HPI provided by the Federal Housing Finance
					Agency, but it only showed the relative price of housing over time for each city independently.
					Thus, the main considerations when choosingn a source of housing price data was that the data be an
					absolute value that is comparable between cities, and that the data have the best possible spatial
					and temporal resolution (as discussed above).

				<h2>How clean is the data? Does this data contain what we need?</h2>
				<p style="bottom:-20%"> <b style="color:#2f74b5">How many data points are there total? How many are
						there in each group you care about? Do you think this is enough data to do what you hope to
						do?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> 263,653 so far, for the years 2013 to 2017 inclusive. We estimate that the data up until 2020 will include another ~100,000 data points. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> 40,840, which should be enough to divide the US in small groups for
					analysis. <br>
					<b> Housing Price Database: </b> There are 27,554 towns/cities which each have up to 260 price
					estimates, ranging from 1996 to 2013. Some price estimates are missing, but most have data going
					back to at least 2013, which is the year that the gun violence archive data begins.<br><br>
					<b style="color:#2f74b5">Are there missing values? Do these occur in fields that are important for
						your project's goals?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> Yes, there are some missing fields. While our most important fields, n_killed and n_injured, are always accounted for, we sampled a few hundred rows and discovered that ~5% of rows lack any location data, which may exacerbate our efforts to analyze data by more detailed location areas like cities, counties, and districts. In addition, while most entries provide contextual details about the participants (victims and suspects), some entries lack any participant details or context at all. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> No, this database is relatively clean.<br>
					<b> Housing Price Database: </b> Some cities are missing price estimates for the early years. This
					isn't particularly important for our project since we will still have plenty gun violence data from
					areas with a wide variety of housing prices even if we have to discard some examples due to lack of
					price data.<br><br>
					<b style="color:#2f74b5">Are there duplicates? Do these occur in fields that are important for your
						project's goals?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> There are no duplicates; each incident is only represented once. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> There are no duplicates. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> There are no duplicates; each town/city is unique.<br><br>
					<b style="color:#2f74b5">How is the data distributed? Is it uniform or skewed? Are there outliers?
						What are the min/max values?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> The data appears somewhat uniform, as there's usually at least a handful of entries for each day. In terms of number killed or injured, there are quite a few incidents with 0-5 killed or injured, and more infrequently, there are incidents with dozens killed or injured. So far, we haven't gone as far as determining whether entries are more frequent in certain months than others. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> For some areas where the population is 0 or there are no land masses or housing data, the calculation for population density resulted in undefined so the csv data gave (X) for those areas and I chose to represent this as -1 in our database. <br>
					<b> Housing Price Database: </b> Looking at the housing price estimates by city/town for January,
					2020, it appears that the data is skewed and there are outliers. most of the data points fall in the
					range of a couple hundred thousand dollars, or under one hundred thousand dollars for smaller towns.
					The distribution is skewed right with a few outlier towns have housing prices in the millions. The
					highest housing price estimate was 15.4 million dollars. <br>
					<b style="color:#2f74b5">HAre there any data type issues? Where are these coming from? How will you
						fix them?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> There aren't any issues per se with data types. However, our data does feature dicts and lists that have had to be represented creatively as delimited strings. We'll have to destructure these from SQL when we analyze the data. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> For some areas where the population is 0 or there exist no land masses
					or housing data, the calculation for population density resulted in undefined. Hence, the csv data
					gave (X) for those areas, and I chose to represent this as -1 in our database. <br>
					<b> Housing Price Database: </b> There were no significant data type errors. Some of the town names
					had non utf-8 symbols in their names which made them hard to read in Python. These instances were
					changed to have the most similar utf-8 symbol.<br><br>
					<b style="color:#2f74b5">Do you need to throw any data away? What data? Why? Any reason this might
						affect the analyses you are able to run or the conclusions you are able to draw?</b><br>
					<b> Gun Violence Database: </b> The comparatively limited number of entries on 2013 means that if we're doing any statistical analysis that depends on the rate of incidents, we should throw out 2013 and focus on the well-populated years of 2014 and on. In doing so, we will marginally limit the scope of our data and therefore our findings. <br>
					<b> Population Database: </b> For areas where the population is 0, we likely will not use this as we
					are trying to say something about incidents of gun violence by area; an area with 0 population or
					where the land area is all water probably won’t have location and therefore there will be no
					meaningful Joins. <br>
					<b> Housing Price Database: </b> None of the data in this dataset specifically needs to be thrown
					away, but incidences of gun violence for which the relevant housing price data is not available may
					need to be thrown away since the housing price data is necessary for our analysis.<br><br>
